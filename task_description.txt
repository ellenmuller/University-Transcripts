Input

You are given 3 input files which are located under the data\ folder. Each file contains student transcript records from various universities. There are a total of 3 files representing these transcripts across each university. The filename represents each university’s name.

Requirements
You are tasked to do some basic analysis on this dataset on behalf of a government Oversight Board that is evaluating each university’s performance. Some of the analysis they requested from you is below:

	•	What are the top 3 most popular classes spanning all universities? The intent here is to find the classes that are common across all universities and sort them by count of student attendance. 
	•	What are the courses offered by no more than 1 university and what is the number of students enrolled in each?
	•	What is the % passing rate at each university? A passing grade is defined as any grade about 50% or above a D+

The Oversight Board would also like to have you present your approach to this problem. For the presentation, the Board would like to see you cover the following topics:

	•	Brief overview of your pipeline and why you chose this particular design and tools. 
	•	How would you deal with newly incoming datasets from other universities? 
	•	The Board is also evaluating widening the analysis they asked you to do. You should talk about the flexibility of your solution to future ad-hoc analysis.

Lastly, the Board requests that you share your end to end pipeline including all elements of the system with them via GitHub, email or similar sources. 

You are free to choose any database/storage solution as well as your own pipeline and development languages. For the analysis, you can simply output the results in your presentation. Additional bonus if your solution has a presentation layer.
